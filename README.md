# PCB Circle Detection Tool (MFC VC++)

This project is a machine vision tool developed in **MFC VC++** that detects circular components on a PCB (Printed Circuit Board). It computes:

- Outer and inner tangents
- Circle radius
- Circle diameter
- Dist bet Centers

## ðŸ”§ Features

- Built with Microsoft Foundation Classes (MFC)
- Detects and processes circular patterns on PCBs
- Calculates geometric properties such as:
  - Inner/Outer tangents
  - Radius and Diameter
  - Distance bet centers
- Optimized for industrial image inspection

## ðŸ›  Technologies Used

- Visual C++ (MFC)
- OpenCV 
- GDI+
- Custom geometry logic

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
2. Open the `.sln` file in **Visual Studio**
3. Build in debug mode
4. Run and load test images
